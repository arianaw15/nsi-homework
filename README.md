# NsiHomework

The focus of this project is to allow a user to click the associated button and either increase or decrease their points. 

## Features

NsiHomework includes 2 main components, a child and a parent. The child contains the buttons for increasing and decreasing the points displayed in the parent component. To pass the data from the child to the parent I utilized the Output and EventEmitter in the child component.
